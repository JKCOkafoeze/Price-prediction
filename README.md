This study examines various machine learning algorithms for predicting the prices of used cars, focusing on regression and neural network models. The algorithms evaluated include Simple Linear Regression (SLR), Simple Polynomial Regression (SPR), Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The performance of these models was assessed using key metrics such as the coefficient of determination (R²) and Mean Square Error (MSE).

The results reveal that while the ANN model with all features achieved the highest R² score of 99%, the GBR model was chosen for its superior performance when only numerical features were used. Specifically, the GBR model achieved an R² score of 95%, outperforming the RF model in these aspects. GBR was ultimately selected due to its ability to provide accurate predictions with less computational cost and time, especially in scenarios with large datasets and limited computational resources. The study concludes that while ANN can offer the best overall prediction accuracy, GBR presents a more efficient option when computational efficiency is a priority.
